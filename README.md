 Project for inputting a list of courses.  Functionality for Creating, Reading, and Deleting shows into a database using Django framework. Also using a one to many and one to one relation in models.  My first attempt with a one to one.  I also went a little crazy with gradients and styling, but you gotta have fun sometimes.
